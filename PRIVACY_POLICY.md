# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** August 24, 2025

Welcome to **[App Name]**. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we (don’t) collect, how your media is handled, and your choices.

---

## TL;DR

- **On-device processing:** Your videos and extracted audio are processed **locally on your device**.  
- **No account:** We don’t require sign-up/login.  
- **No server uploads:** We don’t send your media files to our servers.  
- **Optional third parties:** If you enable features like ads or crash/usage analytics, limited device data may be shared with those providers (see below).  
- **You control your files:** You can delete outputs at any time (from the app folder, Gallery, or Files app).

---

## What the App Does

[App Name] provides simple, local tools to:
1. **Extract audio** from a video.
2. **Archive/ZIP** a video.
3. **Compress** a video and then **ZIP** it.

All operations are designed to run **on your device**.

---

## Information We Collect

By default, **we do not collect personally identifiable information** (PII).

**Processed locally, not transmitted to us:**
- Videos you select to extract audio, compress, or zip.
- Output files the app generates (audio files, compressed videos, ZIP archives).
- Basic, non-identifying telemetry shown to you in-app (e.g., error messages).

### If Ads or Analytics Are Enabled (Optional)
If your build includes these services, the following may be collected by the provider(s):

- **Advertising (e.g., Google AdMob):** Device identifiers, approximate location, IP address, ad interactions, and related metadata for serving and measuring ads.  
- **Analytics/Crash reporting (e.g., Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics):** Anonymized usage and crash data (e.g., device model, OS version, in-app events/screens, crash logs).

> Review and link each provider’s privacy policy before release. You can disable these services in your build or app settings (if available).

---

## Device Permissions and Why We Ask

- **Photos/Media/Files access:** To read videos you select and to write generated outputs (audio, compressed video, ZIP).  
- **Notifications (optional):** If you choose to receive progress or completion notifications.  
- **Network (optional):** Required only for ads, analytics, or opening web links—**not** for processing your media.

You can change permissions in your device settings. Without the relevant storage permission, the app may not be able to read or save files you choose.

---

## How Your Files Are Handled

- **Local by default:** Extract, compress, and zip operations run on-device.  
- **Your chosen destinations:** Save outputs to your app’s private folder, Gallery (valid media collections), or a user-selected folder via the system file picker.  
- **No hidden uploads:** We do not upload your media to our servers.

---

## Data Retention

- **On device:** Output files remain on your device until **you** delete them (or uninstall the app).  
- **App-private data:** Clearing the app cache or uninstalling may remove app-private files per OS rules.

---

## Children’s Privacy

[App Name] is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact **[Contact Email]**.

---

## Security

We design the app so your media stays on your device. However, no software is perfectly secure. Keep your device OS updated and protect it with a passcode/biometrics.

---

## International Transfers

We do not run servers for your media, so we do not transfer your media files across borders. If you use third-party services (ads/analytics), their infrastructure may process data in other countries—see their policies.

---

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Access/Deletion:** View and delete your files anytime using the app (where supported) or your device’s file manager/Gallery.  
- **Consent:** Disable ads/analytics in settings (if available) or use a build that excludes them.  
- **Permissions:** Revoke storage/notification permissions from system settings at any time.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as we ship new features (e.g., cloud backup or accounts). We’ll change the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, notify you in-app or request consent for material changes.
