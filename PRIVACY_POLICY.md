# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** August 24, 2025

Welcome to **Savior X**. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we collect (and what we don’t), how your media is handled, and your choices.  

---

## TL;DR

- **On-device processing:** Your videos and extracted audio are processed **locally on your device**.  
- **No account:** We don’t require sign-up or login.  
- **No server uploads:** We do not upload your media files to our servers.  
- **Optional third parties:** If ads or analytics are enabled, limited device data may be shared with those providers (see below).  
- **You control your files:** You can delete outputs at any time (from the app folder, Gallery, or Files app).  

---

## What the App Does

**Savior X** provides simple, local tools to:  
1. **Extract audio** from a video.  
2. **Archive/ZIP** a video.  
3. **Compress** a video and then **ZIP** it.  

All operations are designed to run **on your device**.  

---

## Information We Collect

By default, **we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII)**.  

**Processed locally, not transmitted to us:**  
- Videos you select to extract audio, compress, or zip.  
- Output files the app generates (audio files, compressed videos, ZIP archives).  
- Basic, non-identifying telemetry shown to you in-app (e.g., error messages).  

### If Ads or Analytics Are Enabled (Optional)  
If the app build includes these services, the following may be collected by the provider(s):  

- **Advertising (Google AdMob):** Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), approximate location, IP address, ad interactions, and related metadata for serving and measuring ads. See Google’s policy: [Google AdMob Privacy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).  
- **Analytics & Crash reporting (Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics):** Device model, OS version, anonymized usage events, and crash logs. See [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).  

We do not directly access, store, or share this data. Collection is handled by the third-party SDKs.  

---

## Device Permissions and Why We Ask

- **Photos/Media/Files access:** Required to read videos you select and to write generated outputs (audio, compressed video, ZIP).  
- **Notifications (optional):** To notify you of progress or completion.  
- **Network (optional):** Required only for ads, analytics, or opening web links—**not** for processing your media.  

You can manage permissions anytime from your device settings.  

---

## How Your Files Are Handled

- **Local by default:** Extract, compress, and zip operations run on-device.  
- **Your chosen destinations:** Outputs are saved in your app’s private folder, Gallery, or a user-selected folder.  
- **No hidden uploads:** We do not upload or transfer your media to any server.  

---

## Data Retention

- **On device:** Output files remain until **you** delete them or uninstall the app.  
- **App-private data:** Clearing app data or uninstalling may remove app-private files per OS rules.  
- **Third-party SDKs:** Data retention is managed according to each provider’s policies (see their links above).  

---

## Children’s Privacy

**Savior X is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region).**  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that data has been collected from a child, we will delete it promptly.  

---

## Security

We design the app so your media stays on your device. However, no system is perfectly secure. Protect your device with a passcode/biometrics and keep your OS updated.  

---

## International Transfers

We do not run servers for your media. If you use third-party services (ads or analytics), their infrastructure may process data in other countries. Please review their privacy policies:  
- [Google AdMob Privacy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)  
- [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)  
- [Crashlytics Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)  

---

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Access/Deletion:** You can view and delete your files anytime from the app, your Gallery, or your device’s file manager.  
- **Consent:** You may disable ads/analytics in settings (if available) or use a build that excludes them.  
- **Permissions:** You can revoke permissions (storage, notifications) from system settings at any time.  
- **GDPR/CCPA:** Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict certain processing. For advertising, you can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as we add new features. The “Last updated” date will change accordingly. For significant changes, we may notify you in-app or request renewed consent.
